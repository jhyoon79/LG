To run it, symply execute run_all.sh (type "./run_all.sh" in a linux terminal)
Please be careful about PATH.

All output files are in ASCII types which occupy quite a lot of your disk space.
You may want to change it if you plan to run many simulation with different condition.


*** Description of the steps

1) make_initial_Pal5.idl

This converts the radial and tangential velocity of Pal 5 to Vx, Vy, Vz in cartesian coordinates. 


2) compile and run frog_initial_Pal5.f

This gives you the position of Pal 5 "N" Myrs ago.
You can set "N" in the line 2 of 'frogin_initial_Pal5'. It's currently 8440 which means it computes the position of Pal 5 8440 Myr ago. The timestep -1 tells you this code steps backward (to the past).


3) compile and run frog_central.f

This step evolves Pal 5 from the position at "N" Myrs ago to the present time (output file: part0001). This step is needed to set 3000 test particles with reasonable energy and angular momentum .
You can edit 'frogin_central' for changing evolving time and time steps.


4) make_pal5.idl

This produces initial test particles based on the position of Pal 5 from 2).


5) compile and run frog.f

i) frog.f: main code to run

ii) frog.h: define constants and parameters
	edit "out_dir" if you want to specify the output directory

iii) input files for frog.f

* frogin: 
- Line 1: The number of particles should match the number of lines of frog_Pal5.dat. 
- Line 2: The number of steps*timestep is the age of Pal5 you want to see the evolution. For example, in the step 2), you compute the position of Pal 5 8440 Myr ago. If you set the number of steps as 8440*2=16880 and timestep 0.5 Myr, the result must be the current position of Pal 5 which is stored in frog_Pal5_present.dat
- Line 3: timestep 0.5 Myr is determined to conserve energy and angular momentum. 1 Myr is also okay but I tried to be conservative.
- Line 4: number of subhalos. This must match the number of lines of input subhalo list (e.g., frog_VLsubhalo.dat). 
- Ignore line below 4. They are just my notes.

* frog_Pal5.dat: contain initial test particle position, output of make_pal5.idl
 
* frog_VLsubhalo.dat: list of subhalo position and velocity from Via Lactea 2.
* frog_VLsubhalo_e5e6.dat: list of subhalo position and velocity between 10^5 and 10^6Msun from Via Lactea 2.
* frog_VLsubhalo_inner.dat: list of subhalo position and velocity in the inner halo from Via Lactea 2.


iv) output files from frog.f

- part001: time, position, and velocity of Pal 5 (central particle).
- part_peri: time, position, and velocity of the test particles at their pericenter.
- snapshot/snap*****: time, position, and velocity of test particles in each step
- snapshot_subhalo/snap*****: time, position, and velocity of subhalos in each step
  
6) figure1.idl

produce Figure 1 of my 2011 paper. You may not need this.
The result from N-body simulation used in Figure 1 of the paper is lost.
